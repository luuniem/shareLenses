# Share Lenses

## Description
Share Lenses is a single page application, created in Angular 2, that gives local photographers the opportunity to lend and rent lenses. Those who have extra lenses that they're not using and would like to make some money can list them up for rent. Those who has time and are on a budget can rent from individuals who are lending lenses. There are websites such as borrowlenses.com that offers the same concept; however, the difference is Share Lenses caters individuals who are located within the city/town. This would help avoid the cost of shipping and any other hidden fees.

Share Lenses is still a work in progress. Right now, the only feature that works is the search filter that helps narrow down a user's search. There is no data base yet, I will look into getting Firebase to work with Angular 2. You can check out [version 1.0 here](http://luuniem.github.io/shareLenses/index.html)
